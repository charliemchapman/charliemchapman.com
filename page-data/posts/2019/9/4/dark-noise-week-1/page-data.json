That's because I used Apple's pre-order feature, which it turns out will release the app around 12:00am the morning of release date in <strong>local time</strong>, presumably based on which regional App Store the pre-order was made from.</p>\n<p>Since App Store connect appears to update metrics based on midnight California time, anybody who pre-ordered or downloaded the app right away from east of the US such as New Zealand or the UK, will show up on the 26th.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let's look at the numbers.  Day 1 was easily my biggest sales day.  I believe this was mostly made up from the small community I had built up through the beta testing period and some press I received including a wonderful <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/dark-noise-review-ambient-noise-never-looked-so-good/\">review on MacStories</a>.

Ranking actually seems to be pretty correlated with unit sales instead.  So I have no idea why my <strong>App Store Browse</strong> page views started climbing so much to seemingly no effect ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  Dark Noise was just added to the top of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chuckyc17/status/1169058911124635648?s=20\">Apps We Love Right Now</a> list on the US app store but that was after the week 1 date range we're looking at here.</p>\n<p>Now let's talk about that second spike on Saturday.  That was the day I posted about Dark Noise to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cxvg0c/i_released_a_white_noise_ios_app_this_week_with/\">/r/Apple</a> on Reddit.  </p>\n<p>That subreddit is huge, and they allow app devs to post announcements about their apps on Saturdays.  I read about this a while ago, set a reminder on my phone for the Saturday after I was planning to launch, and promptly forgot about it until my phone reminded me Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>The post ended up going to the front page pretty quickly gathering 1,500 upvotes and hundreds of comments which had a pretty clear impact on sales.  If you've got an app coming soon, I cannot recommend this enough.  You can see the results right here!</p>\n<p>I don't have much more analysis, but here are some other metrics that you might find interesting.  And as always feel free to reach out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chuckyc17\">Twitter</a> if you have any questions or metrics you're interested in seeing.
