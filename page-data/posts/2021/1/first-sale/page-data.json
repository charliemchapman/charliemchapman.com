In fact, the only price change I‚Äôve made at all is increasing the price by a few dollars when I shipped my 2.0 update.</p>\n<p>This was due partially to laziness, but also a slight sense of feeling gross about sales for some reason? Truth be told I don‚Äôt have a good reason for this, but I had this generic (and quite frankly silly) notion in the back of my mind that it feels slightly desperate and devalues the product somehow.</p>\n<p>So when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frboulais?s=21\">Fran√ßois</a> reached out about joining his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/indieappsanta\">Indie App Santa</a> project and putting Dark Noise on sale for 50% for 1 day I was weirdly hesitant. But I figured ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the worst that could happen?‚Äù and agreed.</p>\n<p>Based on literally no data I kinda figured that I‚Äôd probably get around double the sales from the Indie App Santa Twitter account promotion and me tweeting about it from my account. At 50% off this would mean I‚Äôd pretty much be breaking even on revenue. Since Dark Noise is paid up front with no subscription or in app purchases, this would basically be a wash with a <em>slight</em> bump in users.</p>\n<p>I was wrong.</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs my sales for the month of december. See if you can spot what day the sale took place! üòÖ</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 750px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/165fa4efcde79c277f51d20c5167f7da/a1bd7/dark-noise-dec-sales.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 30.687830687830687%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Dark Noise December Sales\"\n        title=\"Dark Noise December Sales\"\n        src=\"/static/165fa4efcde79c277f51d20c5167f7da/2a7f3/dark-noise-dec-sales.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/165fa4efcde79c277f51d20c5167f7da/1a190/dark-noise-dec-sales.jpg 188w,\n/static/165fa4efcde79c277f51d20c5167f7da/992ed/dark-noise-dec-sales.jpg 375w,\n/static/165fa4efcde79c277f51d20c5167f7da/2a7f3/dark-noise-dec-sales.jpg 750w,\n/static/165fa4efcde79c277f51d20c5167f7da/f4978/dark-noise-dec-sales.jpg 1125w,\n/static/165fa4efcde79c277f51d20c5167f7da/db64a/dark-noise-dec-sales.jpg 1500w,\n/static/165fa4efcde79c277f51d20c5167f7da/a1bd7/dark-noise-dec-sales.jpg 1890w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p class=\"postCaption\">Note: This is sales, not units so the 50% off is already taken into account.</p>\n<p>This was a <strong>way</strong> bigger bump than I was expecting, easily making up for the price difference. It‚Äôs worth noting it did trail off pretty quickly after the sale ended. It‚Äôs a bit hard to tell exactly how quickly because sales bumped again a few days later on Christmas when the app was mentioned in a few ‚ÄúBest apps for your new phone‚Äù articles.</p>\n<p>One thing I'm curious about is what's driving the sales spike. Indie App Santa has almost 5,000 followers on Twitter who are actively looking for app deals, so I'm curious how much is driven by them and how much is the sale itself.</p>\n<p>Lets look at the <strong>Sources</strong> data provided by App Store Connect.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 750px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/fc1a4a195f84b2bb1a6999a5951dfc38/cc0f5/dark-noise-dec-sources.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 35.874877810361674%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Dark Noise Sales Sources\"\n        title=\"Dark Noise Sales Sources\"\n        src=\"/static/fc1a4a195f84b2bb1a6999a5951dfc38/2a7f3/dark-noise-dec-sources.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/fc1a4a195f84b2bb1a6999a5951dfc38/1a190/dark-noise-dec-sources.jpg 188w,\n/static/fc1a4a195f84b2bb1a6999a5951dfc38/992ed/dark-noise-dec-sources.jpg 375w,\n/static/fc1a4a195f84b2bb1a6999a5951dfc38/2a7f3/dark-noise-dec-sources.jpg 750w,\n/static/fc1a4a195f84b2bb1a6999a5951dfc38/f4978/dark-noise-dec-sources.jpg 1125w,\n/static/fc1a4a195f84b2bb1a6999a5951dfc38/db64a/dark-noise-dec-sources.jpg 1500w,\n/static/fc1a4a195f84b2bb1a6999a5951dfc38/cc0f5/dark-noise-dec-sources.jpg 2046w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>As expected Web Referrers and App Store Search have big spikes, but curiously so is App Store Browse (customers who found the app through general App Store browsing vs direct link or specifically searching my app). Possibly this is because the price is lower so more people who saw the app converted to sales? My conversion rate for the day was up 59.3% (though still very low) but there's so much noise from all the direct sales that this is hard to really tease out what's really going on here.</p>\n<p>Let's dig into where the web referrers are coming from.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 750px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/6e988f9524859a3939715f8c7ebd1808/cc0f5/dark-noise-dec-web-referrers.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 77.90811339198437%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Dark Noise Web Referrers\"\n        title=\"Dark Noise Web Referrers\"\n        src=\"/static/6e988f9524859a3939715f8c7ebd1808/2a7f3/dark-noise-dec-web-referrers.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6e988f9524859a3939715f8c7ebd1808/1a190/dark-noise-dec-web-referrers.jpg 188w,\n/static/6e988f9524859a3939715f8c7ebd1808/992ed/dark-noise-dec-web-referrers.jpg 375w,\n/static/6e988f9524859a3939715f8c7ebd1808/2a7f3/dark-noise-dec-web-referrers.jpg 750w,\n/static/6e988f9524859a3939715f8c7ebd1808/f4978/dark-noise-dec-web-referrers.jpg 1125w,\n/static/6e988f9524859a3939715f8c7ebd1808/db64a/dark-noise-dec-web-referrers.jpg 1500w,\n/static/6e988f9524859a3939715f8c7ebd1808/cc0f5/dark-noise-dec-web-referrers.jpg 2046w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p class=\"postCaption\">The actual numbers here are much lower than the numbers on the aggregated \"Sources\" page in App Store Connect.
