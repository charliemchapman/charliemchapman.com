Here's the pitch: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Launched is a fortnightly show where I interview app developers and other creators about their experiences releasing their creation out into the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last year while I was working towards the release of <a href=\"https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2019/8/27/dark-noise/\">Dark Noise</a> I found that listening to developer interviews on podcasts was extremely helpful in preparing me for what to expect and giving me ideas on how to build a marketing plan around the release.  My hope is that Launched can be a resource for aspiring creators by providing a platform for people to share their experiences launching something into the world.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty excited to see where this goes! Rest assured I'll be posting updates with stats and I'll try to do a post outlining everything I've done to try to market the show similar to what I did with the <a href=\"https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2019/9/27/marketing-dark-noise/\">Marketing Dark Noise</a> post.</p>\n<p>If this sounds interesting you can find links to <a href=\"https://launchedfm.com/subscribe\">subscribe here</a>. And if you enjoy it <strong>please</strong> consider giving me a rating or review in <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/launched/id1491582246\">Apple Podcasts</a></p>\n<p>You can also follow the show on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/launchedfm\">@LaunchedFM</a> and check out the dedicated Subreddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LaunchedFM/\">/r/LaunchedFM</a> to talk with other listeners about the show.</p>\n<p>And if you're a creator who's recently (or soon to be) launched something and would like to tell your story, you can <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxduoOnjnF_qE6PpnEGdKewWHvB3YDl0gv3WAxAJ4HDVq8Bg/viewform\">apply here</a> to potentially come on the show.</p>","excerpt":"Today I'm really excited to be releasing the first episode of my new podcast Launched.
