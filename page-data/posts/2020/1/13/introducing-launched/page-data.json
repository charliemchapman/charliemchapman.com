Here's the pitch: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Launched is a fortnightly show where I interview app developers and other creators about their experiences releasing their creation out into the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last year while I was working towards the release of <a href=\"https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2019/8/27/dark-noise/\">Dark Noise</a> I found that listening to developer interviews on podcasts was extremely helpful in preparing me for what to expect and giving me ideas on how to build a marketing plan around the release.  My hope is that Launched can be a resource for aspiring creators by providing a platform for people to share their experiences launching something into the world.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty excited to see where this goes! Rest assured I'll be posting updates with stats and I'll try to do a post outlining everything I've done to try to market the show similar to what I did with the <a href=\"https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2019/9/27/marketing-dark-noise/\">Marketing Dark Noise</a> post.</p>\n<p>If this sounds interesting you can find links to <a href=\"https://launchedfm.com/subscribe\">subscribe here</a>.
