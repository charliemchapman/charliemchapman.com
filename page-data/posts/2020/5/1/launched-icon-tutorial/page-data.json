I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1255872065711804416?s=21\">tweeted as much</a> and there was a lot of questions asking how I make them.  It's pretty straight forward so I made a little tutorial showing how I make these sketch style app icons using Procreate on my iPad Pro.</p>\n<p>I've also created 2 files that I use when creating these icons that you can download here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://charliemchapman.com/launched-icon-template/launched-icon-template-background.png\">launched-icon-template-background.png</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://charliemchapman.com/launched-icon-template/launched-icon-template-mask.png\">launched-icon-template-mask.png</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, feedback is appreciated. If I said anything dumb (likely) or if you end up using this technique for a project yourself I'd love to hear about it on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/\">Twitter</a>!</p>","excerpt":"For each episode of Launched I create a custom version of the podcast artwork where I replace the paper airplane with a \"sketchified…"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/2020/5/1/launched-icon-tutorial/"}}}
