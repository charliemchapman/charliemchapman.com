That's because I used Apple's pre-order feature, which it turns out will release the app around 12:00am the morning of release date in <strong>local time</strong>, presumably based on which regional App Store the pre-order was made from.</p>\n<p>Since App Store connect appears to update metrics based on midnight California time, anybody who pre-ordered or downloaded the app right away from east of the US such as New Zealand or the UK, will show up on the 26th.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let's look at the numbers.  Day 1 was easily my biggest sales day.  I believe this was mostly made up from the small community I had built up through the beta testing period and some press I received including a wonderful <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/dark-noise-review-ambient-noise-never-looked-so-good/\">review on MacStories</a>.

Ranking actually seems to be pretty correlated with unit sales instead.  So I have no idea why my <strong>App Store Browse</strong> page views started climbing so much to seemingly no effect ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  Dark Noise was just added to the top of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_chuckyc/status/1169058911124635648?s=20\">Apps We Love Right Now</a> list on the US app store but that was after the week 1 date range we're looking at here.</p>\n<p>Now let's talk about that second spike on Saturday.  That was the day I posted about Dark Noise to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cxvg0c/i_released_a_white_noise_ios_app_this_week_with/\">/r/Apple</a> on Reddit.  </p>\n<p>That subreddit is huge, and they allow app devs to post announcements about their apps on Saturdays.  I read about this a while ago, set a reminder on my phone for the Saturday after I was planning to launch, and promptly forgot about it until my phone reminded me Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>The post ended up going to the front page pretty quickly gathering 1,500 upvotes and hundreds of comments which had a pretty clear impact on sales.  If you've got an app coming soon, I cannot recommend this enough.

It's an app for playing different ambient noises to help with sleep or focus.  I'm not a designer by trade, and this is the first app I've made for iOS, so this is more of a brain dump of everything I did and less of a proposal on how design should be done.</p>\n<p>Before I placed a pixel in any design tool, I first figured out what the guiding principles for the app were, and what features I wanted to include.  I detailed this step in a <a href=\"https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2019/8/23/principles-of-dark-noise/\">separate post</a>, but the end result was:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Configurability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Targeting pro users who want as many options and hooks to work the app into their workflow as possible</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opening app to playing sound should be as fast as possible with no compromise since this is the 99% use case</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keep it dark</strong> (expect fat fingers)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most users will probably be using this in a dark environment, possibly without their glasses on or half asleep.

An easy to hit play button, a name, and a way to get to the other sounds.</p>\n<p>The \"Create Noise\" page was based on my original idea of generating the different color noises on the fly, and building a little color picker style control to let you mix your own noise.  For technical/scope reasons I ended up not going this direction at all, but I do anticipate implementing a \"Create Noise\" feature at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>I also had the main swiping gesture for minimizing the player there from the beginning.  One cool thing about Adobe XD is that you can quickly setup prototypes with swiping gestures for animations, and then demo them interactively on the phone.  So I could quickly play around with different ideas and get a sense of how they <em>felt</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-design-prototyping.gif\" alt=\"Dark Noise design version 01\"></p>\n<p class=\"postCaption\">Recorded on my iPhone previewing the XD prototype. I toyed around with having the player minimize to the top, but the rapid prototyping with XD quickly showed me that didn't feel right</p>\n<p>The \"Charcoal Dreams\" name has an interesting back story.  From the beginning I knew I wanted to add some sort of fun whimsical feel to the app.  I thought it might be fun to give each noise an obnoxiously whimsical name, and if you 3D touched the name you'd get a silly description along the lines of \"earthy notes with a hint of cinnamon\" or something.  </p>\n<p>Since I switched strategies to using audio recordings, this didn't make as much sense, but I didn't give up on that goal of having something fun.</p>\n<div class=\"postVideoContainer\">\n    <video class=\"postVideo\"  controls loop>\n    <source src=\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-1st-video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    </video>\n</div>\n<p class=\"postCaption\">First video I could find of a working version of the app.  This was in May, so about 4-5 months in.</p>\n<p>This first design wasn't pretty, but the structural bones were pretty good.  It gave me a direction to go on as I built out the first version of the app.</p>\n<h1>Round 2</h1>\n<p>At this stage I actually had a functional app that had a lot of the features I wanted, but it just looked... bleh.  I am not a designer by trade, so I didn't really know what to do to make this look better.  A designer friend at work pointed me to <a href=\"https://mobbin.design\">Mobbin</a>.  It's a simple website that allows you to view screenshots of hundreds of different well designed apps, with a pretty good search functionality.</p>\n<p> <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

I ended up with a slightly unusual design that treated the first page you see as a maximized player that you have to swipe down to reveal the rest of the app.  </p>\n<p>I was worried it wouldn't be immediately clear <em>how</em> you're supposed to proceed from that page if you wanted to change your noise, so I borrowed a design element from my first MacBook Pro and gave the down arrow a little \"breathing\" animation.  I'm hoping the gentle bounce and opacity change will draw a new users eye enough to guide them through the app, but also not be an annoying distraction in the future.</p>\n<h4>Icon Animations</h4>\n<p>One thing I really like about some other audio apps is when it's visually clear when audio is playing so if your speakers are muted you have an indication that sound <em>should</em> be coming out.  For example, in <a href=\"https://overcast.fm\">Overcast</a>, a darker tint color bounces on the pause button along with the audio that's playing to let you know that there is sound being played.</p>\n<p>I came up with a few ideas in After Effects, but I either couldn't figure out how to implement it properly, or it just didn't feel right once I implemented it into the app.</p>\n<div class=\"postVideoContainer\">\n    <video class=\"postVideo\"  controls loop>\n    <source src=\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-play-pause-ideas.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    </video>\n</div>\n<p class=\"postCaption\">A couple play / pause ideas I tried out.</p>\n<p>One idea I had pretty early on was to make a looping animation for each of the static noise icons I was already building.  This sounded fun for me, but I was afraid it would take a long time and not really be worth the time it would take me.</p>\n<p>At one point I finally decided to try it out and see how it felt.  I made the animation for the White Noise icon and added it to the app, and it just felt awesome.</p>\n<div class=\"postVideoContainer\">\n    <video class=\"postVideo\"  controls loop>\n    <source src=\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-icons-sample.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    </video>\n</div>\n<p class=\"postCaption\">Some of the icons I created for Dark Noise</p>\n<p>This solved my \"playing indicator\" problem, but even more importantly I found the <em>fun</em> I was looking for that I could use to stamp the app with my personality.</p>\n<h1>Last Thoughts</h1>\n<p>There are other small touches throughout the app, but I think this touches on the biggest ones.  Like I said, I'm not a designer by trade, this is just to outline my thought process while I still remember it.

As usual, I think #MykeWasRight.  </p>\n<p>The truth is, I did work really hard and tried <em>a lot</em> of different things.  I have no idea what really worked and what didn't, but I can at least share what I did and explain my mindset.</p>\n<p>I'm going to try to write up as much as I can over the next few weeks while this is fresh on my mind, so keep your eyes on this feed if you're curious.

I wanted to try to make Dark Noise something that is fun to open up and interact with.</p>\n<p>I loaded it up with multiple themes, and (way to many) custom app icon options, but the thing that I'm really proud of is all of the custom animations.  Each noise has a custom icon that comes to life when you start playing it.  And the buttons throughout the UI have little animations peppered throughout to make the app fun and fluid to navigate.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 100%;max-width: 560px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\"><iframe style=\"width:100%\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7BDtu9CkAI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></iframe></div>\n<p>I'm really proud of how Dark Noise came together, but it wouldn't be close to what it is today without all of the help I've received along the way.  First from my friends at work who've essentially let me leech Swifty wisdom from them over the last 8 months.  And also from the iOS developer / enthusiast community.  Over 900 people have joined the beta and provided me with countless bug reports, feature ideas, and marketing advice.  I can't express enough how helpful this has been and it's inspired me to try to lift others up more than I do.</p>\n<p>This is just the beginning and I'm excited to see where Dark Noise goes from here.  As always, I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkNoiseApp\">Twitter</a> or on the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNoiseApp/\">Dark Noise Subreddit</a></p>"}},{"node":{"id":"71903a76-06c4-57e5-b8da-026a2d83b1a2","frontmatter":{"title":"The Principles of Dark Noise","date":"23 August, 2019"},"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019/8/23/principles-of-dark-noise/"},"html":"<p>At the beginning of this year I started working on my first indie app to release in the App Store called <a href=\"https://darknoise.app\">Dark Noise</a>.  It's an ambient noise app for iPhone and iPad.</p>\n<p>At first, I had a giant list of feature ideas and no idea how to distill them into a focused product. So I started by forcing myself to pick 3 principles to guide the design.</p>\n<p>I eventually landed on these core principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Configurability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Targeting pro users who want as many options and hooks to work the app into their workflow as possible</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opening app to playing sound should be as fast as possible with no compromise since this is the 99% use case</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keep it dark</strong> (expect fat fingers)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most users will probably be using this in a dark environment, possibly without their glasses on or half asleep.  Keep that in mind.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After creating the principles, I took my list of feature ideas and tried to slot them all into one of those principles.  If they didn't fit, I tossed them in the backlog.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 750px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d/45cbd/dark-noise-principles-in-action.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 130.6122448979592%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Dark Noise Principles in Action\"\n        title=\"Dark Noise Principles in Action\"\n        src=\"/static/1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d/2a7f3/dark-noise-principles-in-action.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d/1a190/dark-noise-principles-in-action.jpg 188w,\n/static/1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d/992ed/dark-noise-principles-in-action.jpg 375w,\n/static/1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d/2a7f3/dark-noise-principles-in-action.jpg 750w,\n/static/1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d/45cbd/dark-noise-principles-in-action.jpg 784w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Keeping these principles in mind as I tried to design and form an MVP was really helpful.  I have a tendency to get overly excited by an idea and drop whatever I'm doing and build it.  Often that's a bad idea, but sometimes it's good!</p>\n<p>Whenever I had the thought of adding a bunch of custom app icons referencing podcasts I like, I realized it was something that might actually resonate with the pro users I was targeting.
