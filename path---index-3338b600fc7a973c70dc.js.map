It's an app for playing different ambient noises to help with sleep or focus.

An easy to hit play button, a name, and a way to get to the other sounds.</p>\\n<p>The \\\"Create Noise\\\" page was based on my original idea of generating the different color noises on the fly, and building a little color picker style control to let you mix your own noise.  For technical/scope reasons I ended up not going this direction at all, but I do anticipate implementing a \\\"Create Noise\\\" feature at some point in the future.</p>\\n<p>I also had the main swiping gesture for minimizing the player there from the beginning.  One cool thing about Adobe XD is that you can quickly setup prototypes with swiping gestures for animations, and then demo them interactively on the phone.  So I could quickly play around with different ideas and get a sense of how they <em>felt</em>.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-design-prototyping.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Dark Noise design version 01\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"postCaption\\\">Recorded on my iPhone previewing the XD prototype. I toyed around with having the player minimize to the top, but the rapid prototyping with XD quickly showed me that didn't feel right</p>\\n<p>The \\\"Charcoal Dreams\\\" name name has an interesting back story.  From the beginning I knew I wanted to add some sort of fun whimsical feel to the app.  I thought it might be fun to give each noise an obnoxiously whimsical name, and if you 3D touched the name you'd get a silly description along the lines of \\\"earthy notes with a hint of cinnamon\\\" or something.  </p>\\n<p>Since I switched strategies to using audio recordings, this didn't make as much sense, but I didn't give up on that goal of having something fun.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"postVideoContainer\\\">\\n    <video class=\\\"postVideo\\\"  controls loop>\\n    <source src=\\\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-1st-video.mp4\\\" type=\\\"video/mp4\\\">\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\n    </video>\\n</div>\\n<p class=\\\"postCaption\\\">First video I could find of a working version of the app.  This was in May, so about 4-5 months in.</p>\\n<p>This first design wasn't pretty, but the structural bones were pretty good.

I ended up with a slightly unusual design that treated the first page you see as a maximized player that you have to swipe down to reveal the rest of the app.  </p>\\n<p>I was worried it wouldn't be immediately clear <em>how</em> you're supposed to proceed from that page if you wanted to change your noise, so I borrowed a design element from my first MacBook Pro and gave the down arrow a little \\\"breathing\\\" animation.  I'm hoping the gentle bounce and opacity change will draw a new users eye enough to guide them through the app, but also not be an annoying distraction in the future.</p>\\n<h4>Icon Animations</h4>\\n<p>One thing I really like about some other audio apps is when it's visually clear when audio is playing so if your speakers are muted you have an indication that sound <em>should</em> be coming out.  For example, in <a href=\\\"https://overcast.fm\\\">Overcast</a>, a darker tint color bounces on the pause button along with the audio that's playing to let you know that there is sound being played.</p>\\n<p>I came up with a few ideas in After Effects, but I either couldn't figure out how to implement it properly, or it just didn't feel right once I implemented it into the app.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"postVideoContainer\\\">\\n    <video class=\\\"postVideo\\\"  controls loop autoplay>\\n    <source src=\\\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-play-pause-ideas.mp4\\\" type=\\\"video/mp4\\\">\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\n    </video>\\n</div>\\n<p class=\\\"postCaption\\\">A couple play / pause ideas I tried out.</p>\\n<p>One idea I had pretty early on was to make a looping animation for each of the static noise icons I was already building.  This sounded fun for me, but I was afraid it would take a long time and not really be worth the time it would take me.</p>\\n<p>At one point I finally decided to try it out and see how it felt.  I made the animation for the White Noise icon and added it to the app, and it just felt awesome.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"postVideoContainer\\\">\\n    <video class=\\\"postVideo\\\"  controls loop autoplay>\\n    <source src=\\\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-icons-sample.mp4\\\" type=\\\"video/mp4\\\">\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\n    </video>\\n</div>\\n<p class=\\\"postCaption\\\">Some of the icons I created for Dark Noise</p>\\n<p>This solved my \\\"playing indicator\\\" problem, but even more importantly I found the <em>fun</em> I was looking for that I could use to stamp the app with my personality.</p>\\n<h1>Last Thoughts</h1>\\n<p>There are other small touches throughout the app, but I think this touches on the biggest ones.

I wanted to try to make Dark Noise something that is fun to open up and interact with.</p>\\n<p>I loaded it up with multiple themes, and (way to many) custom app icon options, but the thing that I'm really proud of is all of the custom animations.  Each noise has a custom icon that comes to life when you start playing it.  And the buttons throughout the UI have little animations peppered throughout to make the app fun and fluid to navigate.</p>\\n<div style=\\\"width: 100%;max-width: 560px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\\\"><iframe style=\\\"width:100%\\\" width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7BDtu9CkAI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe></iframe></div>\\n<p>I'm really proud of how Dark Noise came together, but it wouldn't be close to what it is today without all of the help I've received along the way.  First from my friends at work who've essentially let me leech Swifty wisdom from them over the last 8 months.  And also from the iOS developer / enthusiast community.  Over 900 people have joined the beta and provided me with countless bug reports, feature ideas, and marketing advice.  I can't express enough how helpful this has been and it's inspired me to try to lift others up more than I do.</p>\\n<p>This is just the beginning and I'm excited to see where Dark Noise goes from here.  As always, I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/DarkNoiseApp\\\">Twitter</a> or on the <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNoiseApp/\\\">Dark Noise Subreddit</a></p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/CharlieMacbook/code/charliemchapman.com/src/posts/2019/8/23/principles-of-dark-noise.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"The Principles of Dark Noise\",\"date\":\"23 August, 2019\"},\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/posts/2019/8/23/principles-of-dark-noise/\"},\"html\":\"<p>At the beginning of this year I started working on my first indie app to release in the App Store called <a href=\\\"https://darknoise.app\\\">Dark Noise</a>.  It's an ambient noise app for iPhone and iPad.</p>\\n<p>At first, I had a giant list of feature ideas and no idea how to distill them into a focused product. So I started by forcing myself to pick 3 principles to guide the design.</p>\\n<p>I eventually landed on these core principles:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Configurability</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Targeting pro users who want as many options and hooks to work the app into their workflow as possible</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Speed</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Opening app to playing sound should be as fast as possible with no compromise since this is the 99% use case</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Keep it dark</strong> (expect fat fingers)</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Most users will probably be using this in a dark environment, possibly without their glasses on or half asleep.  Keep that in mind.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After creating the principles, I took my list of feature ideas and tried to slot them all into one of those principles.  If they didn't fit, I tossed them in the backlog.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-0af4d.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 130.6122448979592%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Dark Noise Principles in Action\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-5520a.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-52dbb.jpg 188w,\\n/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-b4884.jpg 375w,\\n/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-5520a.jpg 750w,\\n/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-0af4d.jpg 784w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Keeping these principles in mind as I tried to design and form an MVP was really helpful.

I'm generally pretty quick to pick something new up, and I get distracted easily so I end up doing this a lot.</p>\\n<p>I bring this up because at the beginning of this year I moved into iOS development, a whole new ecosystem<sup id=\\\"fnref-1\\\"><a href=\\\"#fn-1\\\" class=\\\"footnote-ref\\\">1</a></sup> where I didn't know the language (Swift), framework (UIKit), or any of the tooling (Xcode), and in the last week I reached one of my favorite milestones of learning a new skill: <strong>thinking with portals</strong>.</p>\\n<p>In Valve's 2007 game <em>Portal</em>, you have to solve a series of puzzle's using a unique \\\"Portal\\\" gun that allows you to arbitrarily place portals on the walls, and you can jump through them.  While simple on the surface, it's deceptively complicated, and at first you sort of fumble your way through the mechanic to make it through the challenges.</p>\\n<p>Eventually you will suddenly realize you're brain automatically looks at a puzzle and starts calculating portal placements and jump trajectories, and the game's robot narrator praises you with the phrase <em>\\\"Now you're thinking with portals\\\"</em>.</p>\\n<p>This same phenomenon occurs every time I learn a new software development skill.  I'm not talking about the part where you know you can fumble your way through any problem with enough time, though that is exciting as well.  This is the part where your brain automatically thinks within the framework or pattern you're using in the background, and instead you're free to focus on the actual design or engineering problem at hand.</p>\\n<p>This over the last week, I've stopped spending my time figuring out <em>how</em> to do something on my iOS projects, but instead figuring out the best design that I <em>should</em> do.  It's a subtle difference, but it's deeply satisfying to finally cross that threshold.</p>\\n<p>The beginning of learning a new skill is always daunting, but I know that, if I stick with it, eventually I'll reach the <em>Thinking With Portals</em> moment and that's one of the greatest feelings in the world.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n<hr>\\n<ol>\\n<li id=\\\"fn-1\\\">\\n<p>I actually have done a bit of mobile development back in the day with Windows Phone 😂, but for the most part I've been up and down the web stack for my career.</p>\\n<a href=\\\"#fnref-1\\\" class=\\\"footnote-backref\\\">↩</a>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/CharlieMacbook/code/charliemchapman.com/src/posts/2018/11/27/google-home-christmas-time.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Control Your Christmas Tree Lights with Google Home\",\"date\":\"27 November, 2018\"},\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/posts/2018/11/27/google-home-christmas-time/\"},\"html\":\"<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-882d9.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 52.5390625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Google Home\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-5520a.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-52dbb.jpg 188w,\\n/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-b4884.jpg 375w,\\n/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-5520a.jpg 750w,\\n/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-882d9.jpg 1024w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>A couple of years ago when we set up our Christmas tree, we bought a cheap little <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Westek-RFK1600LC-Indoor-Wireless-Switch-x/dp/B000HJBE68/ref=sr_1_10?s=lamps-light&#x26;ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1543371600&#x26;sr=1-10&#x26;keywords=remote+light+switch\\\">RF light switch</a> to plug our tree into so we didn't have to climb underneath the tree to turn on and off the lights.  In the last year, we acquired a Google Home Mini, and I decided we could try to make our Christmas tree experience a little smarter.</p>\\n<p>After a bit of experimentation, I can now say \\\"Hey Google, It's Christmas Time\\\" and my tree lights up, Christmas music starts playing, and my TV turns on and starts playing a fireplace.

There are hundreds of smart plugs on Amazon, but you want to make sure you get one that's compatible with Google Assistant.  I got <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072ZX8RTZ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\\\">this one from Gosuna</a>, but I think the same instructions will apply with any smart plug.</p>\\n<p>To set it up, I just plugged my tree lights into the smart plug, and the smart plug into the wall.  I followed the instructions that came with my plug to get it hooked up to Google Home (which included downloading their app) but ultimately you need your smart plug to show up in the Google Home app page like below (I've nicknamed mine \\\"Decoration Lights\\\").</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/google-home-app-a76d498e2aa87f4921585073bca93a78-f687c.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 506px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 197.62845849802372%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Google Home App Screenshot\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/google-home-app-a76d498e2aa87f4921585073bca93a78-f687c.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/google-home-app-a76d498e2aa87f4921585073bca93a78-1dfac.png 188w,\\n/static/google-home-app-a76d498e2aa87f4921585073bca93a78-fdf3e.png 375w,\\n/static/google-home-app-a76d498e2aa87f4921585073bca93a78-f687c.png 506w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Now you should be able to tap the \\\"On\\\" / \\\"Off\\\" buttons in the Google Home app and see that your Christmas tree lights turn on and off correctly.

Just say \\\"Ok Google, It's Christmas Time\\\" and your lights should turn on.</p>\\n<h2>Add Some Music</h2>\\n<p>Alright, now you have a custom routine, but it's only doing one action.  Let's make things more interesting by playing some Christmas music as well as turning on the lights.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Tap on your custom routine</li>\\n<li>Tap \\\"ADD MEDIA\\\"</li>\\n<li>Check the \\\"Music\\\" radio button</li>\\n<li>Tap the gear icon next to \\\"Music\\\"</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>And type into the text box \\\"<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Christmas Radio</code>\\\" (or whatever command you would use to trigger a custom playlist or album)</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>This will use whatever music service you've set up as the default.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Give it a shot.  Say \\\"Ok Google, It's Christmas Time\\\" and your lights should turn on, and Christmas music should start playing out of your speaker.</p>\\n<h2>Put a Fire on the TV</h2>\\n<p>Ok, this is probably the trickiest one, and may not work for many of you.  Let's start by explaining how I have my TV setup.</p>\\n<p>I have a Chromecast (1st generation) plugged in to an HDMI port on my TV, but powered by plugging into the wall, not the TV's usb port (this is important).  My TV supports <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control\\\">HDMI-CEC</a>, which is a spec that allows devices like BluRay players, video game consoles, and Chromecasts control your TV over HDMI.</p>\\n<p>In my case, my TV will allow my Chromecast to turn on the TV and switch to the input my Chromecast is connected too.  But it will not allow my Chromecast to turn off my TV for reasons unknown.</p>\\n<p>If your TV does not support HDMI-CEC then you will have to manually turn on your TV and switch it to the Chromecast's input.</p>\\n<p>Alright, with that aside, here's how I set up the fireplace within my new Routine.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Open your custom routine</li>\\n<li>Tap \\\"ADD ACTION\\\"</li>\\n<li>Type into the text field \\\"<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_LUpnjgPso on TV</code>\\\"</li>\\n<li>Tap \\\"ADD\\\" on the top right</li>\\n<li>Tap \\\"Save\\\" on the top right</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Typing into that text box let's you arbitrarily type any command you can say to your Google Home.  So you could type \\\"Play Fireplace on TV\\\" here and Google will search Youtube and find a fireplace to put on your TV.</p>\\n<p>But what if you want to play a specific video?  Since we're typing into this command instead of talking out loud to our Google Home, we can actually clarify a specific Youtube video URL to play instead of just doing a search.  </p>\\n<p>To do that you first need to get the URL for that video by tapping \\\"share\\\" in the Youtube app or just copying the url from the browser.  Then you can just paste that URL into the command \\\"<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Play [insert-url-here] on TV</code>\\\". </p>\\n<p><em>If you have multiple TVs in the house, you might also have to specify which TV such as \\\"Play Fireplace on living room TV\\\".</em></p>\\n<p>Now when you say \\\"Ok Google, It's Christmas Time\\\", your tree lights should turn on, music should start playing from your speaker, and your TV should turn into a fireplace!</p>\\n<h2>Keep Tinkering</h2>\\n<p>So now that you have the basic building blocks, you should be able to expand on this idea quiet a bit.</p>\\n<p>You could create a new routine called \\\"Cancel Christmas\\\" that turns off the lights, fireplace, and music.  Or you could add an action to ask Google Home to tell you how many days till Christmas.</p>\\n<p>Routines are a bit confusing, and the current Google Home app certainly doesn't make that process easier, but it can be really powerful.  Even with just a couple pieces of smart hardware you can build up some impressive workflows pretty quickly.</p>\\n<p>Hopefully this was helpful!

This reached a fever pitch with the release of the new (and pretty great looking) <a href=\\\"https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/\\\">iPad Pros</a> and the onslaught of reviews deeming the new device amazing but \\\"still an iPad\\\".</p>\\n<p>As someone deep in the Mac ecosystem but definitely interested in iOS, I've always regarded these complaints as people being overly sensitive.  When people say they can't do \\\"real work\\\" on an iPad, I've always translated that to mean they can't do \\\"their work\\\" on an iPad.

Only this time both platforms, iOS and MacOS, are owned by the same company.</p>\\n<p>It's weird because I don't really see them as competing platforms as much as complementing platforms.  A Mac, an iPad, and an iPhone make an incredible combination.  It's more like an iMac vs a MacBook. People with desktop computers don't usually make fun of laptops being underpowered.  And laptop users don't usually make fun of desktop's lack of portability. And many people have both!</p>\\n<p>Admittedly none of this matters.  It's probably just typical Twitter / Tech Blog drama.

For technical/scope reasons I ended up not going this direction at all, but I do anticipate implementing a \\\"Create Noise\\\" feature at some point in the future.</p>\\n<p>I also had the main swiping gesture for minimizing the player there from the beginning.  One cool thing about Adobe XD is that you can quickly setup prototypes with swiping gestures for animations, and then demo them interactively on the phone.  So I could quickly play around with different ideas and get a sense of how they <em>felt</em>.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-design-prototyping.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Dark Noise design version 01\\\"></p>\\n<p class=\\\"postCaption\\\">Recorded on my iPhone previewing the XD prototype. I toyed around with having the player minimize to the top, but the rapid prototyping with XD quickly showed me that didn't feel right</p>\\n<p>The \\\"Charcoal Dreams\\\" name name has an interesting back story.  From the beginning I knew I wanted to add some sort of fun whimsical feel to the app.  I thought it might be fun to give each noise an obnoxiously whimsical name, and if you 3D touched the name you'd get a silly description along the lines of \\\"earthy notes with a hint of cinnamon\\\" or something.  </p>\\n<p>Since I switched strategies to using audio recordings, this didn't make as much sense, but I didn't give up on that goal of having something fun.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"postVideoContainer\\\">\\n    <video class=\\\"postVideo\\\"  controls loop>\\n    <source src=\\\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-1st-video.mp4\\\" type=\\\"video/mp4\\\">\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\n    </video>\\n</div>\\n<p class=\\\"postCaption\\\">First video I could find of a working version of the app.  This was in May, so about 4-5 months in.</p>\\n<p>This first design wasn't pretty, but the structural bones were pretty good.

I ended up with a slightly unusual design that treated the first page you see as a maximized player that you have to swipe down to reveal the rest of the app.  </p>\\n<p>I was worried it wouldn't be immediately clear <em>how</em> you're supposed to proceed from that page if you wanted to change your noise, so I borrowed a design element from my first MacBook Pro and gave the down arrow a little \\\"breathing\\\" animation.  I'm hoping the gentle bounce and opacity change will draw a new users eye enough to guide them through the app, but also not be an annoying distraction in the future.</p>\\n<h4>Icon Animations</h4>\\n<p>One thing I really like about some other audio apps is when it's visually clear when audio is playing so if your speakers are muted you have an indication that sound <em>should</em> be coming out.  For example, in <a href=\\\"https://overcast.fm\\\">Overcast</a>, a darker tint color bounces on the pause button along with the audio that's playing to let you know that there is sound being played.</p>\\n<p>I came up with a few ideas in After Effects, but I either couldn't figure out how to implement it properly, or it just didn't feel right once I implemented it into the app.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"postVideoContainer\\\">\\n    <video class=\\\"postVideo\\\"  controls loop autoplay>\\n    <source src=\\\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-play-pause-ideas.mp4\\\" type=\\\"video/mp4\\\">\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\n    </video>\\n</div>\\n<p class=\\\"postCaption\\\">A couple play / pause ideas I tried out.</p>\\n<p>One idea I had pretty early on was to make a looping animation for each of the static noise icons I was already building.  This sounded fun for me, but I was afraid it would take a long time and not really be worth the time it would take me.</p>\\n<p>At one point I finally decided to try it out and see how it felt.  I made the animation for the White Noise icon and added it to the app, and it just felt awesome.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"postVideoContainer\\\">\\n    <video class=\\\"postVideo\\\"  controls loop autoplay>\\n    <source src=\\\"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.charliemchapman.com/blog/dark-noise-icons-sample.mp4\\\" type=\\\"video/mp4\\\">\\n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\\n    </video>\\n</div>\\n<p class=\\\"postCaption\\\">Some of the icons I created for Dark Noise</p>\\n<p>This solved my \\\"playing indicator\\\" problem, but even more importantly I found the <em>fun</em> I was looking for that I could use to stamp the app with my personality.</p>\\n<h1>Last Thoughts</h1>\\n<p>There are other small touches throughout the app, but I think this touches on the biggest ones.

I wanted to try to make Dark Noise something that is fun to open up and interact with.</p>\\n<p>I loaded it up with multiple themes, and (way to many) custom app icon options, but the thing that I'm really proud of is all of the custom animations.  Each noise has a custom icon that comes to life when you start playing it.  And the buttons throughout the UI have little animations peppered throughout to make the app fun and fluid to navigate.</p>\\n<div style=\\\"width: 100%;max-width: 560px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;\\\"><iframe style=\\\"width:100%\\\" width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7BDtu9CkAI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe></iframe></div>\\n<p>I'm really proud of how Dark Noise came together, but it wouldn't be close to what it is today without all of the help I've received along the way.  First from my friends at work who've essentially let me leech Swifty wisdom from them over the last 8 months.  And also from the iOS developer / enthusiast community.  Over 900 people have joined the beta and provided me with countless bug reports, feature ideas, and marketing advice.  I can't express enough how helpful this has been and it's inspired me to try to lift others up more than I do.</p>\\n<p>This is just the beginning and I'm excited to see where Dark Noise goes from here.  As always, I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/DarkNoiseApp\\\">Twitter</a> or on the <a href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNoiseApp/\\\">Dark Noise Subreddit</a></p>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/CharlieMacbook/code/charliemchapman.com/src/posts/2019/8/23/principles-of-dark-noise.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"The Principles of Dark Noise\",\"date\":\"23 August, 2019\"},\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/posts/2019/8/23/principles-of-dark-noise/\"},\"html\":\"<p>At the beginning of this year I started working on my first indie app to release in the App Store called <a href=\\\"https://darknoise.app\\\">Dark Noise</a>.  It's an ambient noise app for iPhone and iPad.</p>\\n<p>At first, I had a giant list of feature ideas and no idea how to distill them into a focused product. So I started by forcing myself to pick 3 principles to guide the design.</p>\\n<p>I eventually landed on these core principles:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Configurability</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Targeting pro users who want as many options and hooks to work the app into their workflow as possible</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Speed</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Opening app to playing sound should be as fast as possible with no compromise since this is the 99% use case</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Keep it dark</strong> (expect fat fingers)</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Most users will probably be using this in a dark environment, possibly without their glasses on or half asleep.  Keep that in mind.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After creating the principles, I took my list of feature ideas and tried to slot them all into one of those principles.  If they didn't fit, I tossed them in the backlog.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-0af4d.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 130.6122448979592%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Dark Noise Principles in Action\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-5520a.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-52dbb.jpg 188w,\\n/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-b4884.jpg 375w,\\n/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-5520a.jpg 750w,\\n/static/dark-noise-principles-in-action-1696799ffa1b72e000d580b6f9576e2d-0af4d.jpg 784w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Keeping these principles in mind as I tried to design and form an MVP was really helpful.

I'm generally pretty quick to pick something new up, and I get distracted easily so I end up doing this a lot.</p>\\n<p>I bring this up because at the beginning of this year I moved into iOS development, a whole new ecosystem<sup id=\\\"fnref-1\\\"><a href=\\\"#fn-1\\\" class=\\\"footnote-ref\\\">1</a></sup> where I didn't know the language (Swift), framework (UIKit), or any of the tooling (Xcode), and in the last week I reached one of my favorite milestones of learning a new skill: <strong>thinking with portals</strong>.</p>\\n<p>In Valve's 2007 game <em>Portal</em>, you have to solve a series of puzzle's using a unique \\\"Portal\\\" gun that allows you to arbitrarily place portals on the walls, and you can jump through them.  While simple on the surface, it's deceptively complicated, and at first you sort of fumble your way through the mechanic to make it through the challenges.</p>\\n<p>Eventually you will suddenly realize you're brain automatically looks at a puzzle and starts calculating portal placements and jump trajectories, and the game's robot narrator praises you with the phrase <em>\\\"Now you're thinking with portals\\\"</em>.</p>\\n<p>This same phenomenon occurs every time I learn a new software development skill.  I'm not talking about the part where you know you can fumble your way through any problem with enough time, though that is exciting as well.  This is the part where your brain automatically thinks within the framework or pattern you're using in the background, and instead you're free to focus on the actual design or engineering problem at hand.</p>\\n<p>This over the last week, I've stopped spending my time figuring out <em>how</em> to do something on my iOS projects, but instead figuring out the best design that I <em>should</em> do.  It's a subtle difference, but it's deeply satisfying to finally cross that threshold.</p>\\n<p>The beginning of learning a new skill is always daunting, but I know that, if I stick with it, eventually I'll reach the <em>Thinking With Portals</em> moment and that's one of the greatest feelings in the world.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n<hr>\\n<ol>\\n<li id=\\\"fn-1\\\">\\n<p>I actually have done a bit of mobile development back in the day with Windows Phone 😂, but for the most part I've been up and down the web stack for my career.</p>\\n<a href=\\\"#fnref-1\\\" class=\\\"footnote-backref\\\">↩</a>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/CharlieMacbook/code/charliemchapman.com/src/posts/2018/11/27/google-home-christmas-time.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Control Your Christmas Tree Lights with Google Home\",\"date\":\"27 November, 2018\"},\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/posts/2018/11/27/google-home-christmas-time/\"},\"html\":\"<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-882d9.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 52.5390625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Google Home\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-5520a.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-52dbb.jpg 188w,\\n/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-b4884.jpg 375w,\\n/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-5520a.jpg 750w,\\n/static/google-home-hero-01-5029c3ba407be6be298a83671f8b1d50-882d9.jpg 1024w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>A couple of years ago when we set up our Christmas tree, we bought a cheap little <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/Westek-RFK1600LC-Indoor-Wireless-Switch-x/dp/B000HJBE68/ref=sr_1_10?s=lamps-light&#x26;ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1543371600&#x26;sr=1-10&#x26;keywords=remote+light+switch\\\">RF light switch</a> to plug our tree into so we didn't have to climb underneath the tree to turn on and off the lights.  In the last year, we acquired a Google Home Mini, and I decided we could try to make our Christmas tree experience a little smarter.</p>\\n<p>After a bit of experimentation, I can now say \\\"Hey Google, It's Christmas Time\\\" and my tree lights up, Christmas music starts playing, and my TV turns on and starts playing a fireplace.

There are hundreds of smart plugs on Amazon, but you want to make sure you get one that's compatible with Google Assistant.  I got <a href=\\\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072ZX8RTZ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\\\">this one from Gosuna</a>, but I think the same instructions will apply with any smart plug.</p>\\n<p>To set it up, I just plugged my tree lights into the smart plug, and the smart plug into the wall.  I followed the instructions that came with my plug to get it hooked up to Google Home (which included downloading their app) but ultimately you need your smart plug to show up in the Google Home app page like below (I've nicknamed mine \\\"Decoration Lights\\\").</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/google-home-app-a76d498e2aa87f4921585073bca93a78-f687c.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 506px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 197.62845849802372%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Google Home App Screenshot\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/google-home-app-a76d498e2aa87f4921585073bca93a78-f687c.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/google-home-app-a76d498e2aa87f4921585073bca93a78-1dfac.png 188w,\\n/static/google-home-app-a76d498e2aa87f4921585073bca93a78-fdf3e.png 375w,\\n/static/google-home-app-a76d498e2aa87f4921585073bca93a78-f687c.png 506w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Now you should be able to tap the \\\"On\\\" / \\\"Off\\\" buttons in the Google Home app and see that your Christmas tree lights turn on and off correctly.

Just say \\\"Ok Google, It's Christmas Time\\\" and your lights should turn on.</p>\\n<h2>Add Some Music</h2>\\n<p>Alright, now you have a custom routine, but it's only doing one action.  Let's make things more interesting by playing some Christmas music as well as turning on the lights.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Tap on your custom routine</li>\\n<li>Tap \\\"ADD MEDIA\\\"</li>\\n<li>Check the \\\"Music\\\" radio button</li>\\n<li>Tap the gear icon next to \\\"Music\\\"</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>And type into the text box \\\"<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Christmas Radio</code>\\\" (or whatever command you would use to trigger a custom playlist or album)</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>This will use whatever music service you've set up as the default.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Give it a shot.  Say \\\"Ok Google, It's Christmas Time\\\" and your lights should turn on, and Christmas music should start playing out of your speaker.</p>\\n<h2>Put a Fire on the TV</h2>\\n<p>Ok, this is probably the trickiest one, and may not work for many of you.  Let's start by explaining how I have my TV setup.</p>\\n<p>I have a Chromecast (1st generation) plugged in to an HDMI port on my TV, but powered by plugging into the wall, not the TV's usb port (this is important).  My TV supports <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control\\\">HDMI-CEC</a>, which is a spec that allows devices like BluRay players, video game consoles, and Chromecasts control your TV over HDMI.</p>\\n<p>In my case, my TV will allow my Chromecast to turn on the TV and switch to the input my Chromecast is connected too.  But it will not allow my Chromecast to turn off my TV for reasons unknown.</p>\\n<p>If your TV does not support HDMI-CEC then you will have to manually turn on your TV and switch it to the Chromecast's input.</p>\\n<p>Alright, with that aside, here's how I set up the fireplace within my new Routine.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Open your custom routine</li>\\n<li>Tap \\\"ADD ACTION\\\"</li>\\n<li>Type into the text field \\\"<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_LUpnjgPso on TV</code>\\\"</li>\\n<li>Tap \\\"ADD\\\" on the top right</li>\\n<li>Tap \\\"Save\\\" on the top right</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Typing into that text box let's you arbitrarily type any command you can say to your Google Home.  So you could type \\\"Play Fireplace on TV\\\" here and Google will search Youtube and find a fireplace to put on your TV.</p>\\n<p>But what if you want to play a specific video?  Since we're typing into this command instead of talking out loud to our Google Home, we can actually clarify a specific Youtube video URL to play instead of just doing a search.  </p>\\n<p>To do that you first need to get the URL for that video by tapping \\\"share\\\" in the Youtube app or just copying the url from the browser.  Then you can just paste that URL into the command \\\"<code class=\\\"language-text\\\">Play [insert-url-here] on TV</code>\\\". </p>\\n<p><em>If you have multiple TVs in the house, you might also have to specify which TV such as \\\"Play Fireplace on living room TV\\\".</em></p>\\n<p>Now when you say \\\"Ok Google, It's Christmas Time\\\", your tree lights should turn on, music should start playing from your speaker, and your TV should turn into a fireplace!</p>\\n<h2>Keep Tinkering</h2>\\n<p>So now that you have the basic building blocks, you should be able to expand on this idea quiet a bit.</p>\\n<p>You could create a new routine called \\\"Cancel Christmas\\\" that turns off the lights, fireplace, and music.  Or you could add an action to ask Google Home to tell you how many days till Christmas.</p>\\n<p>Routines are a bit confusing, and the current Google Home app certainly doesn't make that process easier, but it can be really powerful.  Even with just a couple pieces of smart hardware you can build up some impressive workflows pretty quickly.</p>\\n<p>Hopefully this was helpful!

This reached a fever pitch with the release of the new (and pretty great looking) <a href=\\\"https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/\\\">iPad Pros</a> and the onslaught of reviews deeming the new device amazing but \\\"still an iPad\\\".</p>\\n<p>As someone deep in the Mac ecosystem but definitely interested in iOS, I've always regarded these complaints as people being overly sensitive.  When people say they can't do \\\"real work\\\" on an iPad, I've always translated that to mean they can't do \\\"their work\\\" on an iPad.  I assumed nobody outside of internet trolls were actually saying that people who use iPads aren't \\\"real\\\" professionals..</p>\\n<p>Then I read <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1063216386573504512\\\">this tweet</a> from senior editor at <a href=\\\"https://www.theverge.com\\\">The Verge</a>, Tom Warren</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Nilay made this point on Vergecast, but the people who have replaced their laptops with an iPad are people who do fuck all work. The rest of us hard working people use a laptop, because we have real stuff to do other than send emails and fart around. Don’t @ me ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>&mdash; Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1063216386573504512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\\">November 15, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src=\\\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"></script> \\n<p>Granted, Tom's primary focus is Windows news, but I think this goes to show that this sentiment of the iPad as a toy is not relegated to comment section flame wars, but actual influential members of the prominent tech press.</p>\\n<p>It feels like we're entering a bizarre OS war reminiscent of the Windows vs Mac or Android vs iOS days, complete with passionate angry \\\"fans\\\" attacking the each other as being \\\"stuck in the past\\\" or \\\"using toys to try to do real work\\\".  Only this time both platforms, iOS and MacOS, are owned by the same company.</p>\\n<p>It's weird because I don't really see them as competing platforms as much as complementing platforms.  A Mac, an iPad, and an iPhone make an incredible combination.  It's more like an iMac vs a MacBook. People with desktop computers don't usually make fun of laptops being underpowered.  And laptop users don't usually make fun of desktop's lack of portability. And many people have both!</p>\\n<p>Admittedly none of this matters.  It's probably just typical Twitter / Tech Blog drama.  But on behalf of non-iPad users everywhere, I'm sorry for the jerks out there.  iOS is not ready to replace my Mac (I don't think<sup id=\\\"fnref-1\\\"><a href=\\\"#fn-1\\\" class=\\\"footnote-ref\\\">1</a></sup>), but that doesn't mean it's not ready for anybody.  Personally, I'm hoping <a href=\\\"https://www.cultofmac.com/546401/ios-13-will-boast-great-updates-for-ipad-users/\\\">iOS 13</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.imore.com/marzipan\\\">Marzipan</a> lead to a glorious future where iOS and MacOS can frolic together, hand in hand, into the glorious computing future.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n<hr>\\n<ol>\\n<li id=\\\"fn-1\\\">\\n<p>While there are definitely some things I simply cannot do in iOS yet, I bet I can do more of my computing on an iPad than I currently think.</p>\\n<a href=\\\"#fnref-1\\\" class=\\\"footnote-backref\\\">↩</a>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n</div>\"}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"/Users/CharlieMacbook/code/charliemchapman.com/src/posts/2018/09/02/first_post.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"First Post\",\"date\":\"02 September, 2018\"},\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/posts/2018/09/02/first_post/\"},\"html\":\"<p>It's been a while since I wrote a blog.  A quick look at my old Blogger account shows my last post was August 5, 2012.  That was 2 jobs, 2 kids, and 1 house ago!</p>\\n<p>I'm not sure why I stopped, but over the last couple of months I've found myself wanting to write again. Unfortunately the task of getting a blog up an running again has always stopped me.  Last week I finally decided to jump in and build a new site.</p>\\n<p>I had really good experience with <a href=\\\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\\\">Gatsby</a> building the website for my podcast <a href=\\\"https://atownfm.com/\\\">A-Town FM</a> so I decided to use it again, and boy I'm glad I did.  I've had so much fun putting the site together over the last week that I've completely forgotten what the article I wanted to write was that sparked me to build this in the first place.</p>\\n<p>For some reason I've always had an easy time starting projects, and putting the time in to truly build them out.  But when it comes time to actually release them to the world, the need to get it <em>just right</em> freezes me up to the point that I often don't release at all.</p>\\n<p>I'm hoping by releasing this post with this (probably buggy<sup id=\\\"fnref-1\\\"><a href=\\\"#fn-1\\\" class=\\\"footnote-ref\\\">1</a></sup>) version of the site to the world, I'll get over that hump and just enjoy adding to it over time.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"footnotes\\\">\\n<hr>\\n<ol>\\n<li id=\\\"fn-1\\\">\\n<p>Seriously, I haven't even opened the page on a Windows computer, much less Edge.
