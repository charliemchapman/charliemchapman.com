This year one of my goals was to try to get into confrence speaking. That... uh... isn't exactly working out thanks to our good friend COVID-19. But I was given the opportunity to do a quick talk for a remote [NSCoder Chicago](https://www.nscoder-chicago.com) meetup and I talked about an experiment I've been doing using  UIInterpolatingMotionEffect to create some parallax effects in UIKit. This is a raw screen recording with only my audio.
