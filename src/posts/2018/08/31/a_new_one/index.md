Alright so I need to test a couple things and this feels like the best place to do it since

1. It's got the latest date on it so it *should* show up at the top
1. I'm actually manually writing this one so it should be pretty easy to get all my sample crap in here

### Images

The real story here is how to get images to show correctly in a page generated by markdown.  Specifically if it's being hosted on the blog itself.  Here's an attempt at an image now!

![My Wallpaper](./Material-Design-Dark-Background-Wallpapers-23170.jpg)

If I did that right, it should show a picture of my glorious grey wallpaper I use on my phone and computer with a little caption that says "My Wallpaper".
