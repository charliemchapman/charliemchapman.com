A quick look at my old Blogger account shows my last post was August 5, 2012.

Unfortunately the task of getting a blog up an running again has always stopped me.

I\'ve had so much fun putting the site together over the last week that I\'ve completely forgotten what the article I wanted to write was that sparked me to build this in the first place.</p>\n<p>For some reason I\'ve always had an easy time starting projects, and putting the time in to truly build them out.
